Requirements:
- Follow AGENTS.md rules.
- Do not push directly to the main branch. Use a branch, open a PR, post a summary comment that mentions @metyatech, then merge and close the PR if there are changes.
- If there are no safe changes, exit cleanly without opening a PR or reporting.
- After merging a PR, check out the main branch and pull to sync the merge locally.
- If the repo has uncommitted changes, exit without making changes.
- Repository creation, splitting, renaming, archiving, or deletion is allowed when needed.
- At the end, output a summary block delimited by:
AGENT_RUNNER_SUMMARY_START
<summary>
AGENT_RUNNER_SUMMARY_END
Include: changes made, tests run (or 'Not run'), and commit hashes.",
